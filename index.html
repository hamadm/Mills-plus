    <footer id="rulesText"><a onclick="hideRules();" href="#">Hide Rules</a> <br/><span>Rules:</span><br/> The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections or points. 
Each player has nine pieces, usually colored black and white. Players try to form three of their own pieces lined horizontally or vertically on a line allowing a player to remove an opponent's piece from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces, or by leaving him without a legal move.<br/><br/>
The game consist of two phases:<br/>
1- Placing the pieces: The players place their pieces in the intersections of the one after the other until the board is full. If a player could form a straight line, he can remove any piece of the other player that is in the board.<br/>
2- Moving the pieces: After all the pieces have been placed the players start moving the pieces in adjacent intersection point in the line. When a player have three pieces in a line he will be able to remove one any of the opponent pieces. And after creating a three in a line the player wouldnâ€™t be able to do the same line again throughout all the rest of the game. The game ends if the player has only two pieces or he has no moves. <br/><br/>For more check out the <a href="https://github.com/hamadm/Mills-plus">Devolpers GitHub page </a>
